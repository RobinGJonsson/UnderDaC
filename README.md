## Bugs 
- Getting all cookies from a request 
- Closing the pop up message from before it the time out is over causes an exception because now there is nothing to close
- Maps don't resize on home page

## Fixed Bugs
- Static files doesn't get uploaded with heroku
- Could not deploy to heroku because the main folder "underdac" was called "UnderDaC" in the Procfile and the settings
